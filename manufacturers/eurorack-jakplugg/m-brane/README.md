re the MIDI jacks, you can use kobiconn stereo jacks (pc mount, not solder tab) instead of the thonk ones, but you should pull them up to the panel with the nut before soldering them, because they are a little shorter than the thonk ones.

Note: Early versions of the board have the gate outs reversed, (but not the LEDs) there is an alternative firmware in the "reverse_gates_firmware" folder
